I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of _Electrical and Computer Engineering_ at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC), working on _machine learning_ with theoretical guarantees. My advisor is Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/), and I am also collaborating with Prof. [Ruoyu Sun](https://ruoyus.github.io/) and Prof. [Zhaoran Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HSx0BgQAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in 2019 from UIUC with double majors in (1) Statistics & Computer Science, (2) Physics. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Niao He](http://niaohe.ise.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Jian Peng](http://jianpeng.web.engr.illinois.edu/) on machine learning.

My current research interest is on deep learning in multi-task scenarios, including *meta-learning*, *multi-task learning*, and *life-long/continual learning*. I am trying to provide a deeper theoretical understanding of them while developing applicable algorithms.
